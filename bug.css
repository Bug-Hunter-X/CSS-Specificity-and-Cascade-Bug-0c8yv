The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an uncommon error related to specificity and the cascading order:  .container { color: blue; } #id .container { color: red; }  The issue arises when you might expect the more specific selector `#id .container` to override `.container`. While it *should*, unexpected behavior could emerge if you have other stylesheets or complex styles interfering with the cascade. The red color might not apply, and you may need to use !important to force it (though that's generally discouraged).
